Description:                                                                                                                                                                                                         
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based face mask detection system. It classifies images into two categories: "With Mask" and "Without Mask." The project includes data preprocessing, model architecture definition, training, and performance evaluation.                                                                                                                                                 
The model is built using TensorFlow, and Python.

Dataset:                                                                                                                                                                                                              
The dataset is not included in this repository. You need to download the dataset from Kaggle.
